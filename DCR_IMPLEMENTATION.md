# Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) Implementation ✅

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

Your Databricks MCP Server now supports **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**, making it incredibly easy for Claude.ai users to connect without managing credentials!

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **New `/register` Endpoint** (line 1978)
- Allows Claude.ai to automatically register itself
- Generates unique client_id and client_secret for each instance
- Maps dynamic clients to your single Azure Entra ID app

### 2. **Updated Discovery Endpoint** (line 1944)
- Added `registration_endpoint` to OAuth discovery
- Claude.ai can now auto-discover the registration capability

### 3. **Enhanced `/authorize` Endpoint** (line 2016)
- Validates dynamically registered clients
- Flexible redirect URI matching for Claude.ai's random ports
- Tracks DCR clients for proper authentication flow

### 4. **Updated `/token` Endpoint** (line 2298)
- Validates client credentials for DCR clients
- Ensures secure token exchange

### 5. **Debug Endpoint `/dcr-clients`** (line 1959)
- Lists all registered DCR clients
- Useful for monitoring and debugging

### 6. **Enhanced Dashboard** (line 1115)
- Clear instructions for Claude.ai users
- Shows DCR benefits and setup steps
- Quick access to DCR client list

## 🚀 How Users Connect Now

### Before DCR (Complicated):
1. User asks you for client_id and client_secret
2. You share credentials (security risk)
3. User manually enters credentials in Claude.ai
4. User authenticates with Microsoft
5. Connected

### After DCR (Simple):
1. User pastes your URL in Claude.ai:
   ```
   https://databricks-mcp-server-1761712055023179.19.azure.databricksapps.com
   ```
2. Claude.ai auto-registers (no credentials needed!)
3. User authenticates with Microsoft
4. Connected! ✅

## 🔧 Azure Setup Required

Add these redirect URIs to your Azure App Registration:
- `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback`
- `https://claude.com/api/mcp/auth_callback`
- `https://claude.anthropic.com/api/mcp/auth_callback`

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_dcr.py
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **No Credential Management**: Users don't need to ask for or manage client IDs/secrets
2. **Enhanced Security**: Each Claude instance gets unique credentials
3. **Better User Experience**: Just paste URL and login - that's it!
4. **Enterprise-Ready**: Works with corporate Microsoft accounts
5. **Scalable**: Works for 1 or 10,000 users without any changes

## 📊 Technical Details

### DCR Flow:
1. Claude.ai calls `/register` with its redirect URIs
2. Server generates unique client_id and client_secret
3. These are mapped to your real Azure app credentials internally
4. Claude.ai uses the dynamic credentials for OAuth flow
5. Server validates and maps back to Azure app for actual authentication

### Security Features:
- Dynamic credentials are stored in `oauth_sessions` with `dcr_` prefix
- Client secrets are validated during token exchange
- Redirect URI validation ensures only registered URIs work
- OBO (On-Behalf-Of) authentication still works perfectly

## 🎉 Success!

Your Databricks MCP Server now has industry-standard DCR support! This is the same approach used by:
- Atlassian
- Zapier
- Microsoft Graph
- Google Workspace

Users can now connect to your Databricks instance through Claude.ai with just your server URL - no credential distribution needed!

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated `app.py` to your Databricks Apps
2. Add the Claude.ai redirect URIs to your Azure App Registration
3. Share just the server URL with users
4. Enjoy the simplified connection process!
